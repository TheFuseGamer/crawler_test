# Order Payment Summaries

Create an OrderPaymentSummary for an OrderSummary. Specify a payment
      authorization or payments that share the same payment method. In an org with the multicurrency
      feature enabled, the OrderPaymentSummary inherits the CurrencyIsoCode value from the
      OrderSummary.

          - Response body for POST

              - - When the HTTP status code indicates success, the response body is a [Create Order Payment Summary Output](atlas.en-us.230.0.order_management_developer_guide.meta/order_management_developer_guide/connect_responses_create_order_payment_summary_output.htm "ID of the created Order Payment Summary."). The response
                body can still indicate processing errors.
- When the HTTP status code is in the 400 (client error) or 500 (server error)
                range, the response body is an [Error with Output](atlas.en-us.230.0.order_management_developer_guide.meta/order_management_developer_guide/connect_responses_error_with_output.htm "Contains extra information about errors. In rare cases, an error message isn't enough to describe the reason for a failure. For example, when a conflicting precondition exists, the error result can include the information about the cause of the conflict."). The <samp class="codeph nolang">output</samp> property is a [Create Order Payment Summary Output](atlas.en-us.230.0.order_management_developer_guide.meta/order_management_developer_guide/connect_responses_create_order_payment_summary_output.htm "ID of the created Order Payment Summary."), and the value
                of the <samp class="codeph nolang">enhancedErrorType</samp> property can be
                ignored.
