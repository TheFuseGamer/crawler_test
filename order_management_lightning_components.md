# Salesforce Order Management Lightning Components

Salesforce Order Management includes standard Lightning components .

## Order Product Summaries by Recipient Component

Use the Order Product Summaries by Recipient component to display order product details on an     Order Summary record page. This component is available in Salesforce Order Management.

The Order Product Summaries by Recipient component displays information about the order     delivery group summaries associated with the order summary, including the order product     summaries associated with them.

The displayed order product summary fields are defined by the Order Product Summaries related     list on the OrderDeliveryGroup object page layout. To modify the columns in this component on     the order summary details page, edit the related list on the Order Delivery Group page layout,     not the Order Summary page layout.

You can create a custom filter to control which order delivery group summary records are     displayed.

## Order Summary Totals

Use the Order Summary Totals component to display order financial totals on an Order Summary     record page. This component is available in Salesforce Order Management.

You can customize the panel title and which values to display.
