# Flow Core Action for Order Management: Ensure Funds Async

Ensure funds for an invoice and apply them to it. If needed, capture
      authorized funds by sending a request to a payment provider. This action inserts a background
      operation into an asynchronous job queue and returns the ID of that operation so you can track
      its status. Payment gateway responses appear in the payment gateway log and do not affect the
      background operation status.

#### Note

If multiple order payment summaries have the same amount, their order of selection is         random.

1. Verify that the invoice balance doesnâ€™t exceed the total amount of all the order payment
          summaries.
2. If an order payment summary exists with an amount that matches the invoice balance, use
          it.
3. Otherwise, if any order payment summaries exist with an amount greater than the invoice
          balance, use the one with the smallest amount greater than the invoice balance.
4. Otherwise, select order payment summaries in order from largest amount to smallest until
          their amounts meet or exceed the invoice balance.
5. If any selected funds are authorized, capture them.
6. Apply the selected funds to the invoice.
